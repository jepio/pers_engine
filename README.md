pers_engine
===========

A persistency engine to convert data from ROOT binary format to XML and subsequently process it. Written for my class.

Requires:
*   Python 2.7
*   Numpy
*   PyROOT
*   Matplotlib

Run by executing `python2.7 persengine.py` or `./persengine.py`

Run and follow the onscreen instructions. As a default a *input_data.root* will be turned into *input_data.xml*. You can also save plots in *png*, *pdf*, *eps* and print the index of an XML file.

Currently working on trending.
