pers_engine
===========

A persistency engine to convert data from ROOT binary format to XML and subsequently process it. Written for my class.

Requires:
*   Python 2.7
*   Numpy
*   PyROOT
*   will require Matplotlib

Run by executing
`python2.7 persengine.py`

As a default a *input_data.root* will be turned into *input_data.xml*.

Far from ready.
