The documentation of the **pers_engine** has been built using the Sphinx Python package. The plain text version is available in the *text* directory.
To build further versions of the documentation, such as:

* PDF
* HTML
* epub

make sure you have Sphinx installed and run e.g.:

```bash
make html
```
or under windows:

```
make.bat html
```
The documentation will then be available in the *_build* directory.

Further information about Sphinx is available on [the project homepage](http://sphinx-doc.org "Spinx Documentation Generator")
